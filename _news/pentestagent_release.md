I am pleased to announce the release of [PentestAgent](https://github.com/nbshenxm/pentest-agent), an LLM-driven automated penetration testing framework. :tada::tada: Feel free to try out the tool, share your thoughts, and let us know if you run into any issues. If you find PentestAgent useful, do give it a star on GitHub. :star::star:
