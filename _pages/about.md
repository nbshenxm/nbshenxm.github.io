I'm a 6th year PhD candidate advised by Prof. [Yan Chen](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ychen/) at Northwestern University Computer Science Department. As cyber-attacks become increasingly sophisticated and stealthy, it becomes more imperative and challenging to detect intrusion from normal behaviors. Defending against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) requires a nuanced understanding of both offensive and defensive strategies. Defense techniques are developed to guard against offensive techniques, while offensive techniques are developed to explore defense weaknesses and evaluate defense effectiveness. My research explores the interplay between these aspects, aiming to fortify cybersecurity defenses by continually pushing the boundaries of both offensive and defensive techniques.
