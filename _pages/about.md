I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Hofstra University. Before joining Hofstra, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Northwestern University, where I worked with Prof. [Yan Chen](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ychen/).

My research focuses on system security and AI for security, with particular interest in applying artificial intelligence techniques to enhance both defensive and offensive aspects of system security. I develop automated frameworks that bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and practical real-world applications, with work spanning automated penetration testing, intrusion detection systems, and security evaluation methodologies. I have published at top-tier security venues including NDSS, AsiaCCS, and IEEE TDSC, and actively serve the research community through program committee roles for premier security conferences.

I am currently looking for motivated students interested in system security, AI security, or related areas to work with me. Students will have opportunities to work on cutting-edge problems at the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, contributing to both fundamental research and practical security tools. Interested students can reach out to me via email with their CV.
