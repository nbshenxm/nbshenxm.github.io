Specifically, we designed a whole-graph analysis method, which utilizes additional control flow and data flow information to measure the performance of EDR systems. Besides, we analyze MITRE evaluation's results over multiple years from various aspects, including detection coverage, detection confidence, detection modifier, data source, compatibility, etc."}],"interests":[{"name":"APT detection","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["End-point Detection and Response","Provenance-based Intrusion Detection System"]},{"name":"LLM-based Pentesting","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Large Language Model","Retrieval Augmented Generation"]}],"projects":[{}]}
